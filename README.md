# Water-and-Power-System-Interconnectedness
Repository includes: Power Distribution Simulink model, Water Distribution Simulink model, Integrated model, Final dissertation.

The combined model allows for the simulation of a disruption in power distribution in order to analyse the consequences on water distribution.
Matlab version 2020b was used to create the Simulink models (Simscape toolbox required). 

The dissertation discusses interdependent water and power networks and their vulnerability to disturbances. An analysis of the consequences of a disruption at different times of the day is conducted, as well as an analysis of the effect fault duration has on water distribution. Overall, the paper underscores the intricate nature of infrastructure interconnection, as well as the importance of improving resilience in such systems which would lead to a better quality of life for society.
